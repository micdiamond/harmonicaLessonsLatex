        \subsection{Piano man}
           -Listen to Piano man and clap along to the rhythm. (This will make sure you are exactly on the beat, because you can't fudge it with the melody.\\
           -Playing along to backing track: \\https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtFDklau8o0 \\
           -Follow the notes that are the furtherst to the right (the highest notes are the same as the harmonica).
