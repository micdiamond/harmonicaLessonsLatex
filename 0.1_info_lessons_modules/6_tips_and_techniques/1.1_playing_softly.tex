\section{Tips}
\subsection{Playing Softly}
If you play too hard (with too much airflow), your reeds will fracture in the first couple of months, and some of the notes won't play anymore. 

The safe zone is up to about 40\% of the airflow you were playing with at the start of the lesson. 

\subsubsection{Exercise - to improve breath control}
Start as quiet as you can possibly play, and gradually increase the volume to 40\% (up to the 'safe zone limit') as you play the tune.
