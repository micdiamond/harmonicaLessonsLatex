\section*{Notation}
The notation tells you:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What hole number to play 
            % \begin{itemize}    
                % \item The higher the number, the higher the pitch.
                % \item The draw note is a higher pitch than the blow note
            % \end{itemize}
            
        \item Whether to breathe in (draw) or breathe out (blow).
            \begin{itemize}    
                \item No Circle = Blow (Breathe out)
                \item Circle = Draw (Breathe in)
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item
                        \item e.g. \four = Four blow (inhale on the 4th hole)
                        \item
        \margincloud{Ignore the arrows. They are an alternative notation to thecircles.}
                        \item e.g. \4 = Four draw (breathe in on the 4th hole)
                        \item
                        \item e.g. \tfd =  Breathe in on holes 3 & 4 at the same time
                        \item
                        \item e.g. \ottd = Draw on holes 1, 2 and 3 all at the same time 
                        \item
                        \item e.g. \ottb = Blow on holes 1, 2 and 3 all at the same time                    
                    \end{itemize}
                    
                        % \margincloud{Ignore the up and down arrows.}

                    
                % Circles are visually easier for the brain to recognise. I have only included both for people who are already familiar with arrows. 
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

%     \subsection*{Notation method 2: Arrows}
%         \item Up Arrow = Draw = Inhale 
%         \item Down Arrow = Blow = Exhale 

% \subsection{My recommondation - Ignore the arrows}
%     Ignore the arrows and just look at the circles. This is visually easier for the brain to recognise. I have only included both for people who are already familiar with arrows. 

% \item Number = the hole number on the harmonica.
% \item Lower numbers are lower notes.
% \item At the bottom end of the harmonica, the draw note is a higher note than the blow note
