    \section{The Diamonica Customised Training Harmonica - A harmonica with training wheels}

    Designed to help you to learn:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Pentatonic / Blues Scale (The main scale for the harmonica)
        \item How to play single notes (Most beginners have trouble playing one note at a time)
        \item To avoid the high notes (They usually sounds bad)
    \end{itemize}

    The Diamonica customised harmonica can not play notes which lie outside of the blues scale - these notes have been blocked with tape. 
    After you learn the notes of these scales, you can open up the harmonica and take off the stickers.

    This harmonica prevents you from playing chords.
    But at the start of your harmonica journey, it's good to skip this step, because playing chords and random notes is a trap where most people get stuck.
    I think it is better to integrate chords after you have \textit{memorised the pentatonic scale} and after you can \textit{play single notes}.
