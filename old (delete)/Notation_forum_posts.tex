Hi guys

I have used  a few different notation and tablature programs for doing guitar charts. One of them that I really like for it's flexibility is Lilypond. If any of you are familiar with LaTex (used for scientific writing by most physicists, mathematicians, and many engineers) then you will feel at-home with Lilypond.

Anyhow I have been thinking about - and have actually started - writing some Lilypond code to accommodate the particular needs of harp players with respect to notation and tablature reading and writing. I have my own ideas about what I want to include in these modifications. What I would like to know is: What harmonica-specific notation and tablature functionality would you put on your wish list?
